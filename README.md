# Pia's

![Web application showing a musical keyboard with some notes highlighted](./images/screenshot.png)

`Pia's` stands for "Pia's Interval Analysis Screen". `Pia's` is a MIDI analysis web application. 

In Japanese, `Pia's` can be written as „Å¥„ÅÇ„ÅÆ which is pronounced "piano" (üéπ).

`Pia's` is also my first try at writting a small WASM web application.

## Features

- Full size (88-key) keyboard visualization.
- Listens to a single MIDI input device, like a MIDI keyboard.
- Understands common musical scales. Notes outside the scale are highlighted differently. A text overlay indicates the scale degree of each pressed note.
- Understands the use of the sustain pedal. Notes sustained by the pedal are colored differently than held notes.
- Identifies common chords and their extensions.
- Pressed / held keys are colored according to their relationship to the tonic center, i.e. each scale degree has its own color.
- Highlights the overtones of the pressed note.

**NOTE** `Pia's` does not produce audio nor MIDI output. Do not expect sound to come from it..

## Color theme

The color theme has been chosen by overlaying the 12-color wheel (with red, yellow and blue as primary colors) on top of the circle of fifths.

That results in the following colors, going through the circle of fifths in clockwise direction.

| Degree | Color                    |
|:------:|:------------------------:|
| 1      | red (primary)            |
| 5      | red orange (tertiary)    |
| 2      | orange (secondary)       |
| 6      | yellow orange (tertiary) |
| 3      | yellow (primary)         |
| 7      | yellow green (tertiary)  |
| ‚ôØ4     | green (secondary)        |
| ‚ô≠2     | blue green (tertiary)    |
| ‚ô≠6     | blue (primary)           |
| ‚ô≠3     | blue violet (tertiary)   |
| ‚ô≠7     | violet (secondary)       |
| 4      | red violet (tertiary)    |

That means that the notes in major scales get red/yellow colors, which are considered "warm".

Whereas the minor scales include some blue-ish colors which are considered "cool".

## Highlighting overtones

When you pluck the A3 string on a guitar, more than one pitch at 220Hz is heard.
One hears the fundamental frequency and the overtones, frequencies which are multiple of the fundamental frequency.
`Pia's` highlights these overtones but with less intensity than the pressed note;
this mimics reality (as far as acoustic instruments go) as overtones often have less power than the fundamental frequency.

The overtones can be mapped back to an interval with respect to the fundamental frequency.
Consider the following table which lists the overtones of the A2 note (assuming 12-tone equal temperament).

| Frequency (Hz) | ~Note | Interval | Half steps |
|:--------------:|:-----:|:--------:|------------|
| 110            | A2    | P0       | 0          |
| 220            | A3    | P8       | 12         |
| 330            | E4    | P8+P5    | 19         |
| 440            | A4    | 2*P8     | 24         |
| 550            | C#5   | 2*P8+M3  | 28         |
| 660            | E5    | 2*P8+P5  | 31         |
| 770            | G5    | 2*P8+m7  | 34         |
| 880            | A5    | 3*P8     | 36         |
| 990            | B5    | 3*P8+M2  | 38         |
| 1100           | C#6   | 3*P8+M3  | 40         |
| (..)           | (..)  | (..)     |            |
 
These intervals will hold regardless of the note pressed.

## Build dependencies

See [`shell.nix`](./shell.nix).

## Live/hosted instance

May be out of date: https://japaric.github.io/Pia-s

## Run/host locally

0. Connect a MIDI input device to your computer. Note that you can also connect a virtual MIDI loopback device, like 'MIDI Through' on Linux, to the web application and drive it entirely by software, e.g. a DAW.

1. Build the web application and start a web server that listens on port 8000.

``` console
$ just serve
```

2. Browse to `http://localhost:8000`.

3. Grant the web application access to your MIDI devices.

4. Select your MIDI input device from the drop-down menu in the web application.

5. (Optionally) change the Scale using the drop down menus.

6. Input MIDI using your MIDI input device.

**NOTE** Some DAWs take exclusive control of input devices. If you want to use this web application alongside a DAW, you'll need to set up a virtual MIDI loopback device and do some additional routing to duplicate the MIDI input onto a second MIDI device; then each application needs to connect to a different MIDI device. Exact instructions on how to do that are out of scope for this document.
